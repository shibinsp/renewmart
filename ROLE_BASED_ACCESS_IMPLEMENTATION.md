# Role-Based Access Control Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive role-based access control (RBAC) system implemented for the RenewMart platform. The system provides secure, role-specific access to different features and dashboard layouts based on user roles.

## üéØ Problem Solved

### Available Roles
1. **administrator** - Full system access
2. **landowner** - Property management and listing
3. **investor** - Investment opportunities and portfolio management

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Basic Role Checking
```javascript
import { useRoleAccess } from '../hooks/useRoleAccess';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { canAccessAdmin, canAccessLandowner, canPerformAction } = useRoleAccess();
  
  return (
    <div>
      {canAccessAdmin() && <AdminPanel />}
      {canAccessLandowner() && <PropertyManagement />}
      {canPerformAction('view_reports') && <ReportsSection />}
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Route Protection
```javascript
import { AdminRoute, LandownerRoute } from '../components/ProtectedRoute';

// In Routes.jsx
<Route path="/admin" element={
  <AdminRoute>
    <AdminPanel />
  </AdminRoute>
} />

<Route path="/properties" element={
  <LandownerRoute>
    <PropertyManagement />
  </LandownerRoute>
} />
```

### Dashboard Customization
```javascript
// The RoleBasedDashboard component automatically renders
// the appropriate dashboard based on user role
<RoleBasedDashboard />
```

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests
```javascript
import { runAllRoleAccessTests } from '../utils/roleAccessTest';

// Run comprehensive role access tests
const testResults = runAllRoleAccessTests();
console.log(`Pass rate: ${testResults.passRate}%`);
```
